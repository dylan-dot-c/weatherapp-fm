# Issues Faced

List of issues I ran into for doccumentation purposes

1. Been a while since ive used tailwind but I realized that hover styles dont work on mobile anymore because of the @media (hover:hover) rule that doesn't apply hover styles on devices that dont support it.
   The workaround - I just implemented the stylying for the dropdown menu using normal css so it works on both mobile and desktop without adding state and addintional code to handle click events or dropdown state
